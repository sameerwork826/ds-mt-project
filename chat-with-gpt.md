## Overview

This report summarizes the full flow from task classification (seq2seq vs others) through model architecture choices (encoder-only, decoder-only, encoder–decoder), tokenization & preprocessing, the data collator role, the Hugging Face Trainer internals, evaluation metrics (BLEU and alternatives), and practical training arguments and best practices.

## Core concepts and definitions

### Sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq)
- Task: map an input sequence to an output sequence (e.g., translation, summarization).
- Characteristic: both input and output are sequences; training objective is to learn P(output sequence | input sequence).

### Other task types (non-seq2seq)
- Text classification: sequence → single label.
- Token classification: sequence → label per token (NER, POS).
- Question answering: context + question → span (or free-form answer).
- Language modeling: sequence prefix → next token(s).
- Sentence similarity / retrieval: pair of sequences → score/ranking.

### Language modeling paradigms
- Causal Language Modeling (CLM): left-to-right next-token prediction, uses causal masking. Suited for generation.
- Masked Language Modeling (MLM): random token masking with bidirectional context to predict masked positions. Suited for understanding.

---

## Transformer architectures and model families

### Encoder-only
- Structure: Transformer encoder stack only.
- Attention: bidirectional (no causal masking).
- Training objective: typically MLM.
- Suited for: classification, NER, extractive QA.
- Example models: BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT.

### Decoder-only
- Structure: Transformer decoder stack only.
- Attention: masked self-attention (causal mask) so each token sees only previous tokens.
- Training objective: autoregressive next-token prediction (CLM).
- Suited for: text generation, chat, code completion.
- Example models: GPT family, LLaMA, many instruction-tuned LMs.

### Encoder–Decoder (Seq2Seq)
- Structure: Encoder stack encodes input, decoder generates output using encoder outputs (cross-attention + masked self-attention).
- Suited for: translation, summarization, any transformation from input seq → output seq.
- Example models: T5, MarianMT, BART.

---

## Tokenization, preprocessing, and dataset handling

### Tokenization outputs
- input_ids: token ids for input sequence
- attention_mask: mask to indicate real tokens vs padding
- labels: token ids for target sequence (for seq2seq tasks)

### Padding strategies
- padding="longest" or dynamic (per-batch) padding via data collator
- padding=True / padding="max_length" forces all examples to same max length (less memory efficient)
- For labels, padding token ids should be converted to -100 to be ignored by CrossEntropyLoss

### remove_columns in .map
- After tokenization, original raw text columns (e.g., "src", "tgt") remain.
- remove_columns removes raw fields so dataset only contains tokenized fields expected by Trainer.

### Typical preprocess_function (seq2seq)
- Tokenize inputs (encoder side) with truncation and padding as chosen.
- Tokenize targets (decoder side) using tokenizer.as_target_tokenizer() or tokenizer(..., text_target=...) with new HF tokenizers.
- Convert label padding token ids to -100 for loss ignoring.
- Return dict with input_ids, attention_mask, labels.

---

## Collation and batching

### Data collator responsibilities
- Accepts a list of examples and produces a batch (tensors).
- Performs dynamic (per-batch) padding to longest sequence in batch unless already padded.
- Converts lists of ints to PyTorch/TensorFlow tensors.
- For Seq2Seq collators, optionally sets labels' pad ids to -100 if not already done.
- Ensures format compatibility with model.forward and Trainer.

### When collator is still useful even if you pre-pad
- Converts to tensors and ensures consistent keys/shapes expected by Trainer.
- Handles edge cases (e.g., if some examples were not padded identically).
- Keeps training pipeline robust and compatible with Trainer's DataLoader.

---

## Training loop: what Trainer.train() does

Trainer orchestrates the end-to-end PyTorch training loop. Core steps automated by Trainer / Seq2SeqTrainer:

1. Epoch loop over num_train_epochs.
2. DataLoader iteration, using dataset and collate function.
3. Forward pass: model(inputs) → outputs.loss (for supervised training).
4. Backward pass: loss.backward() with support for gradient accumulation.
5. Optimizer update: optimizer.step() and scheduler.step() per configured frequency.
6. optimizer.zero_grad() to clear gradients.
7. Mixed precision handling if fp16 or with accelerator support.
8. Periodic evaluation based on evaluation_strategy:
   - If predict_with_generate=True (Seq2Seq), uses model.generate() to create predictions for metric computation.
9. Metrics computation via provided compute_metrics(eval_pred).
10. Checkpointing according to save_strategy and save_total_limit.
11. Optional load_best_model_at_end (uses metric_for_best_model and greater_is_better).
12. Logging to configured reporters (TensorBoard, WandB, or none).

## Key training arguments (Seq2SeqTrainingArguments)

Essential and commonly tuned fields:

- output_dir: checkpoint + model final output path
- per_device_train_batch_size
- per_device_eval_batch_size
- num_train_epochs
- evaluation_strategy: "no", "steps", or "epoch"
- save_strategy: "no", "steps", or "epoch"
- predict_with_generate: True for seq2seq metric requiring generation (BLEU)
- logging_dir: for tensorboard logs
- load_best_model_at_end: whether to restore best model after training
- metric_for_best_model: metric name to track (e.g., "bleu")
- greater_is_better: True if higher metric is better
- fp16: mixed precision flag
- gradient_accumulation_steps: to simulate larger batch sizes
- save_total_limit: cap number of saved checkpoints

Minimal example for typical Seq2Seq:
```python
training_args = Seq2SeqTrainingArguments(
    output_dir="runs/mt-en-hi",
    per_device_train_batch_size=8,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=8,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    save_strategy="epoch",
    predict_with_generate=True,
    logging_dir="runs/mt-en-hi/logs",
    load_best_model_at_end=True,
    metric_for_best_model="bleu",
    greater_is_better=True
)
```

## Metrics and evaluation

### BLEU (concept)
- Measures n-gram precision (usually up to 4-grams) between candidate and one or multiple reference translations.
- Includes brevity penalty to penalize overly-short outputs.
- Uses modified n-gram counts to prevent repeated token inflation.

Example:
- Reference: "The cat is on the mat"
- Candidate: "The cat sat on the mat"
  - Unigram matches may be high, but longer n-gram matches (trigram, 4-gram) may be zero, so BLEU-4 is low.

### SacreBLEU
- Standardized BLEU implementation to ensure consistent tokenization and parameters across experiments.
- Preferred for reproducibility and comparability with shared tasks.

### chrF
- Character n-gram F-score metric.
- Better suited for morphologically rich languages (captures subword/character overlap).
- Less brittle than BLEU when synonyms or close morphological variants appear.

### COMET
- Neural metric that uses pretrained models/embeddings to estimate translation quality in a way that correlates strongly with human judgments.
- Captures semantic similarity and paraphrase equivalence beyond exact token overlap.

### BLEURT
- BERT-based learned metric fine-tuned on human ratings.
- Combines semantic understanding with sensitivity to fluency/adequacy.

### Practical notes on metrics
- BLEU is fast and reproducible but surface-level; use chrF for morph-rich languages and COMET/BLEURT for semantic/fine-grained evaluation.
- When using predict_with_generate=True, metric computation must decode predictions and labels, handling label -100 → pad_token_id before decode.

---

## Practical code checklist and common pitfalls

1. Tokenizer/model mismatch
   - Use matching model & tokenizer (AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name) + corresponding AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM or AutoModelForCausalLM).
2. Labels: convert padding token ids → -100 to ignore in loss computation.
3. remove_columns: remove raw text columns after tokenization to avoid Trainer confusion.
4. predict_with_generate: set to True if compute_metrics needs generated sequences (BLEU).
5. compute_metrics: when labels contain -100, map them back to pad_token_id before decoding.
6. Data collator: use DataCollatorForSeq2Seq for encoder-decoder; it handles label padding → -100 if needed.
7. Ensure evaluation_strategy and save_strategy values match the transformers version; check API compatibility.
8. SacreBLEU vs sacrebleu import: use evaluate.load("sacrebleu") or sacrebleu.corpus_bleu depending on your implementation; ensure consistent decoding/formatting (list of preds and list-of-list of references).
9. Batch sizes: per_device_train_batch_size must consider GPU memory; use gradient_accumulation_steps to emulate larger effective batch size.
10. predict_with_generate can be slow — limit eval dataset size or use generation kwargs (max_length, num_beams) to constrain compute.

## Example pipeline (detailed outline)

1. Load dataset (datasets.load_dataset with json or other format).
2. Load tokenizer and model:
   - tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(MODEL_NAME, use_fast=True)
   - model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(MODEL_NAME)
3. Preprocess function (batched=True):
   - Tokenize inputs: tokenizer(inputs, truncation=True, max_length=MAX_INPUT_LENGTH, padding="longest" or False)
   - Tokenize targets: with tokenizer.as_target_tokenizer(): tokenizer(targets, truncation=True, max_length=MAX_TARGET_LENGTH, padding="longest" or False)
   - Convert target pad token ids → -100
   - Return model_inputs with keys input_ids, attention_mask, labels
4. tokenized = dataset.map(preprocess_function, batched=True, remove_columns=dataset["train"].column_names)
5. data_collator = DataCollatorForSeq2Seq(tokenizer=tokenizer, model=model)
6. Define compute_metrics(eval_pred):
   - preds, labels = eval_pred
   - if isinstance(preds, tuple): preds = preds[0]
   - decoded_preds = tokenizer.batch_decode(preds, skip_special_tokens=True)
   - labels = np.where(labels != -100, labels, tokenizer.pad_token_id)
   - decoded_labels = tokenizer.batch_decode(labels, skip_special_tokens=True)
   - decoded_labels = [[lbl] for lbl in decoded_labels]  # sacrebleu expects list of references
   - compute and return metric(s) dict
7. Setup Seq2SeqTrainingArguments (see example above)
8. trainer = Seq2SeqTrainer(model=model, args=training_args, train_dataset=tokenized["train"], eval_dataset=tokenized["validation"], tokenizer=tokenizer, data_collator=data_collator, compute_metrics=compute_metrics)
9. trainer.train(); trainer.save_model(output_dir); tokenizer.save_pretrained(output_dir)

---

## Concrete examples and edge cases

- Decoding labels when they contain -100:
  - Replace -100 with tokenizer.pad_token_id before calling tokenizer.batch_decode.
- sacrebleu usage:
  - sacrebleu.corpus_bleu expects candidate list and reference list(s) in a certain format (list of strings, references either list of list).
  - When using evaluate.load("sacrebleu") vs sacrebleu API, ensure decoded_labels shape matches expected shape.
- BLEU breakdown example:
  - Reference: "The cat is on the mat"
  - Candidate: "The cat sat on the mat"
  - Unigram precision high; trigram/4gram low → BLEU-4 low.

---

## Recommendations and best practices

- Choose architecture by task:
  - Understanding tasks → encoder-only (BERT variants).
  - Generation tasks → decoder-only (GPT / LLaMA).
  - Seq2Seq tasks → encoder–decoder (T5, BART, MarianMT).
- Use sacreBLEU for reproducible BLEU scores, chrF for morphologically rich target languages, and COMET/BLEURT for semantic/fluency-aware evaluation.
- Keep compute_metrics lightweight or restrict eval size if generation is slow during validation.
- Use DataCollatorForSeq2Seq even if you pre-pad: it ensures tensor conversion and consistency.
- Use load_best_model_at_end with a validation metric you trust (e.g., COMET if available) rather than raw BLEU if you need semantic quality.
- For low-resource or memory-constrained setups, combine gradient_accumulation_steps and fp16 for effective batch scaling.

## Next steps you can ask me to do (I can implement or show)

- Generate the actual `.md` file content saved for you (copy/paste-ready).
- Convert the outlined example pipeline into runnable, robust Python script with try/except and logging.
- Show side-by-side metric comparisons (BLEU vs chrF vs COMET) on a small sample of EN→HI pairs with concrete numbers and decoded examples.
- Provide a raw PyTorch training loop equivalent to Trainer.train() for direct inspection.
- Create a custom DataCollator example that applies label smoothing or special masking.
